## Very Easy Problems

1. **Return the Sum of Two Numbers**
    - Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Examples addition(3, 2) -> 5 | addition(-3, -6) -> -9. Notes: Don't forget to return the result.
2. **Convert Minutes into Seconds**
    - Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds. Examples convert(5) -> 300 | convert(3) -> 180. Don't forget to return the result.
3. **Return the next number from the integer passed**
    - Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result. Examples addition(0) -> 1 | addition(9) -> 10 | addition(-3) -> -2. Return the result.
4. **Area of a triangle**
    - Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area. Examples triArea(3, 2) -> 3

## Easy Problems

5. **Add up the numbers from a single number**

    - Create a function that takes a number as an argument. Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function. For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
    ```addUp(4) => 10```
